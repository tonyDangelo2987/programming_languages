This project is called Airgead Banking and it allows users to enter information necessary to calculate interest accumulated over a specified amount of years on investments. In order to achieve this, I created a class with member functions. Most of the member functions are private. My favorite part of this project was learning how to use a multidimensional vector. I knew it would be a great fit for what I was trying to accomplish and it paid off. The only thing I would change with this code would be the formatting. Formatting in C++ has always been a little difficult and time consuming for me. The most difficult part of this project for me would also be coding the multidimensional vector. I did some research online to see how they are used which helped a lot. I also did a lot of research on vectors in general just to have a better understanding. This project helped with my organization skills. Having organized code will really help throughout my school career and work career. I do the following when trying to make my code maintainable, readable, and adaptable:
 - Always try to have comments above functions that explain what they do
 - Avoid repetitive code
 - Have descriptive variable/function names
